## Study Plan Basics

Students of the Master's Degree in Cybersecurity must submit a valid study plan ("percorso formativo") for approval to be able to book and take exams. A **study plan** defines the set of teachings a student plans to attend and complete during his/her first and second year.

<!--
A study plan for the Master Programme in Computer Science must comprise 120–123 credits, split as follows:
- 66 credits chosen from those offered within the course programme (with some restrictions, see below);
- 12–15 credits of elective teachings, chosen (in principle) from the entire Sapienza catalogue (must be justified to be approved, you can't simply insert Philosophy 3);
- 6 credits of a supplementary educational activity (in Italian: "Attività Formativa Complementare", in short "AFC"), which might be a seminary, a side project with a professor or a recognized work activity related to Computer Science (check [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRMVE88DZffehZflMrOBiBL2YV40IZ5ZA-naM3d5cZm1Sws1NS9mXGXdrRw0L4a9yObgHgnlwHNQTG8/pub) for further information);
- 36 credits of Master thesis work and defense.
-->

A study plan already in force can be revised by submitting for approval a new plan which includes all teachings whose exams have already been cleared.

## Submission and Revision Dates

You **can submit** your study plans **at most once per year** during the following period:
- From **September 15** to **December 31**

**Study plans still pending evaluation cannot be changed**. For this reason, you are strongly advised to **submit** their study plans **only when you have a clear idea** about which teachings to attend, especially for their next academic year.

You must be enrolled to submit the Study Plan, but you can anyway follow the lectures if you are sure you will graduate within the October or December sessions.

## How to Submit a Study Plan

Study plans must be submitted using the online submission system called **"Percorsi Formativi"**, accessible from within [Infostud](http://www.uniroma1.it/studenti).

## When and How does an Approved Study Plan Come into Effect?

Students whose study plans are approved will receive a notification to their **institutional email address**.

Study plans **come into effect starting from the Academic Year in which they were submitted** and **remain in effect until a new substitute study plan is** eventually submitted and **approved**.

Study plans **approved between September and December will come into force from January 1** of the following year. This means that, **to take any exams in the session held from September to December** (which, in fact, belongs to the previous academic year), **the associated teachings must be part of a study plan approved in the previous academic year**.

The Infostud system forbids students from booking or taking any exam that is not included in their study plan currently in force.

The consequence of this rule is that **students without an approved study plan cannot book or take any exam**.

Once your study plan is approved you can virtually book all the exams and finish your Master's Degree in one semester. In practice **if you book and pass an exam of a semester that you didn't attend yet, the administration might remove it from your career record**. The dangerous part is the "might" because if they notice right before your graduation, you might have to delay it; or, worse, if they notice it after you graduated they can legally invalidate your degree.

## What happens if a study plan is rejected?

If a study plan is rejected, **the student will be immediately contacted by a member of the evaluation committee to give recommendations**, fix the problems, **and find an agreement on a new study plan**, which will be submitted and approved by the committee.

Their **previously approved study plan (if any) will remain in force** and can still be used to book and take exams
