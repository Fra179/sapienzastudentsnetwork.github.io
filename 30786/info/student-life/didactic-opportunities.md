In addition to frontal lessons, Sapienza offers many opportunities to expand your skills and knowledge in a "non-standard" way.

## Sapienza School for Advanced Studies (SSAS)

[The Sapienza School for Advanced Studies (SSAS)](https://web.uniroma1.it/sssas/en) (SSAS) is a didactic path of high formation, parallel to the curricular paths of your degree.

Other advantages offered by SSAS are:
- free housing in Residenza Luca Serianni (a college near the university city)
