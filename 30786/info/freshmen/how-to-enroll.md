Enrolling in Applied Computer Science requires you to follow the following crucial steps:

1. [Preliminary steps](#preliminary-steps)
2. [Taking an admission test](#admission-tests)
3. [Signing up for the preselection (mandatory for non-EU applicants)](#preselection-mandatory-for-non-eu-applicants)
4. [Applying for a visa (only for non-EU applicants)](#visa)
5. [Registering with Infostud and paying the fee for a selection round (usually, there are three selection rounds you can apply to)](#infostud)
6. [Pre-enrolling or enrolling](#pre-enrollment-or-enrollment)

## Preliminary steps

Before starting, there will be some steps that vary depending on which is your nationality. In the call for the course, students are either referred to as **EU** or **non-EU** students; here, we'll use that same split.

You are considered a **EU** student if:
 - you have an Italian citizenship / a citizenship from any EU country;
 - you have a non-EU country but are in possession of a regular residence permit.

If you **do not** fall in one of the previous cases, then you are considered as a **non-EU** student.

**All students**, regardless of their citizenship, must have the following documents in order to enroll:
 - a **high school diploma** taken in / to be obtained in 2025;
 - a valid **entrance test** (see [the admission tests section](#admission-tests) for further details);
 - an adequate knowledge of the English language (see [the English requirements section](#english-requirements) for further details).

Now, if you are a EU citizen, you can skip the following two sections and [go directly here](#english-requirements), otherwise, you should read the following sections, since they contain important info for you.

## Extra documents and visa (for non-EU applicants only)

Here we will mention what non-EU students will need in order to participate to the selection rounds, so any extra documents, the requirements for the visa and some details over MoveIN, the platform used by Sapienza for making non-EU students enroll.

### Extra documents

Non-EU students will need, together with the documents mentioned in [the preliminary steps](#preliminary-steps), the following documents:
 - the pre-acceptance letter (in `.pdf` format) from the pre-selection procedure carried out from [https://www.uniroma1.it/en/admissions](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/admissions);
 - the online pre-enrolment application for the "university enrolment study visa" from the [Universitaly platform](https://www.universitaly.it/). The application must be carried out **before June 30, 2025** on the platform, for the academic year 2025-2026.

### Visa

**Non-EU citizens must apply for a student visa** at the Italian Embassy or Consulate of their jurisdiction. Check if you need a student visa on the [Visa for Italy](https://vistoperitalia.esteri.it/home/en) portal.

If your application has been positively evaluated, the chosen institution will be able to issue a **Letter of eligibility for enrolment**. The competent Italian higher education institution will validate online your application with all the evaluation details required by the competent Italian Diplomatic Consular Mission/Embassy to start your visa application.

Fill in the section **Visa** of the online form: once your request is approved by the Italian Diplomatic Consular Mission/Embassy for the visa, you have to **take an appointment** and go to the Diplomatic Consular Mission/Embassy to obtain your visa.

The validation procedure done by higher education institutions **does not imply** any right to obtain the visa: the decision on visa for study purposes is of exclusive jurisdiction of the competent **Italian Diplomatic Consular Mission/Embassy**.

If you are an EU citizen or come from EFTA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland), **you do not need a visa**. However, if stay in Italy for **more than 3 months**, you should **register with the Anagrafe (Register office) of your Municipality of residence**.

## Preselection (mandatory for non-EU applicants)

The [MoveIN](https://sapienza.gomovein.com/) pre-selection is a required preliminary assessment for non-EU candidates residing abroad and optional for Italian, EU candidates, and non-EU citizens residing in Italy. A positive outcome results in a pre-acceptance letter, inviting the candidate to proceed to the selection process. 

For non-EU citizens abroad, this allows them to submit a pre-enrolment application on [Universitaly](https://www.universitaly.it/) for a study visa by June 30, 2025. Registration details and timeframes for the MoveIN pre-selections are outlined at [this link](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/admissions2024).

To be pre-selected for the degree programme, the following is required:

 - A **high school diploma (or equivalent qualification)** obtained by the school year **2024-2025** and after no less than 12 years of study;
 - Evidence of **adequate knowledge of the English language** according to the parameters indicated in [Annex E](https://www.uniroma1.it/sites/default/files/field_file_allegati/14824_acsai_2024_25_en.pdf);
 - **At least one of the admission tests** indicated in [Section 1](https://www.uniroma1.it/sites/default/files/field_file_allegati/14824_acsai_2024_25_en.pdf) passed with a result of not less than 36/100.

Mind that **pre-selection alone is not sufficient** for enrolment. The following admission process depends on passing the selection. Candidates from non-EU countries legally residing abroad cannot participate in the selection rounds without receiving the pre-acceptance letter and confirming the invitation it contains. For more details, click [here](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/admissions2024).

## English requirements

In addition to the steps explained below, applicants must meet one of the following requirements in English language:

1. a Cambridge English Certificate between FCE, CAE or CPE;
2. a TOEFL with a minimum score of 72 out of 120;
3. an IELTS Academic with a minimum score of 5.5 out of 9;
4. a PTE (Pearson Test of English General) of level 3 – B2 CEFR or higher;
5. a PTE (Pearson Test of English – Academic) with a score no lower than 42;
6. a High School Diploma awarded in english;
7. a self-declaration of being a English native speaker;

Furthermore, **only for EU applicants or non-EU legally residing in Italy** the requirements in English language can be met if:

- the applicant obtain at least 36 points in the English TOLC-I test
- the applicant obtain at least 24 points in the English section of the Italian TOLC-I or TOLC-S.

If you are a non-EU applicant not residing in Italy or a EU applicant that has not obtained enough points in TOLC tests, **you must provide one of the certificates explained in the options 1-5**. The certificate must be sent to [acsai@di.uniroma1.it](mailto:acsai@di.uniroma1.it) by the end of the pre-enrollment for the first round winners or by the end of the enrollment for second and third round winners (see the section [Pre-enrollment or enrollment](#pre-enrollment-or-enrollment))

## Admission Tests

The only official admission tests to access the selections are: TOLC-I, English TOLC-I, TOLC-S or SAT. Furthermore, the test must be taken **before the deadline of the registration period of the chosen selection round** (see Paying the 10€ fee for the Selection). Both TOLC and SAT are considered to have a **validity starting from January of two years before the academic year you enroll for**: if you apply for the Academic Year 2025/2026, only tests taken as from January 2023 to the registration deadlines are accepted for the selection.
