# Graduation Application

{{% hint info %}}
<i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation" style="color: #FFD43B;"></i>
This page is based on the guidelines available on the official [Graduating Student Checklist](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina/graduating-student-checklist) and [On-line Graduation Application](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina/line-graduation-application).
{{% /hint %}}

## Prerequisites

To submit the graduation application, you must first have successfully completed the [Internship](../../third-year/internship/) procedure and passed all the required exams for your degree program.

Next, you need to pay the __Final Exam Fee__, which consists of two revenue stamps, each costing €16, for a total of €32. The payment can be made by generating the payment slip in the section __Degree Courses > Fees > Final Exam__. After a variable waiting period between 1 hour and 24 hours, you will be able to proceed with the graduation application in the section __Degree Courses > Exams > Graduation Application__.

However, before you can submit your application, you must first upload all the __essential personal documents__, which can be uploaded to Infostud in the section __Profile > Personal Documents and Photo__. You will need to upload an _identification document_ (ID card, passport, etc.) and your _tax code_ (health card, tax code card, etc.).

**Attention**

For non-EU students, it is also necessary to upload a valid __Residence Permit__ before being able to create a Graduation Application. If the permit has expired, you will need to upload the renewal kit.

Additionally, you must have successfully __activated your institutional email__, which should have already been completed in your first year.

Once all the steps are completed, the upper part of the section __Degree Courses > Exams > Graduation Application__ should appear as follows. You can create a new Graduation Application by clicking on the _New Application_ button at the bottom.

## Required Documents

During the creation of the Graduation Application, you will be required to attach three documents:
- Study Plan (or Educational Pathway) __[MANDATORY]__
- Receipt of AlmaLaurea questionnaire completion __[MANDATORY]__
- High School Diploma _[OPTIONAL]_

The Study Plan to be attached corresponds to the document summarizing the [study-plan](../../third-year/study-plan/), accessible in the section __Degree Courses > Study Plan__. Once you access your study plan, you can download it using the buttons shown in the following image.

**Attention**

All exams in the Educational Pathway must be recorded at least 2-3 days before the deadline for submitting the Graduation Application (refer to the deadline table in the [Calendar](../../../courses/calendar/)). 
{{% /hint %}}

Regarding the __Receipt of AlmaLaurea questionnaire completion__, you must register, log in, and complete the questionnaire available on the [AlmaLaurea](https://www2.uniroma1.it/AiS/alma/almauno.php) website. Once the questionnaire is completed, you can download the receipt of completion.

<i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation" style="color: #FFD43B;"></i>
**Attention**

The AlmaLaurea questionnaire, which is mandatory, is NOT the same as the Graduation Questionnaire shown in the upper part of the Graduation Application screen. The latter is not even required.
{{% /hint %}}

Uploading the High School Diploma is optional for the student. If you choose not to upload it, the Student Office will contact your high school to verify it, which will increase the processing time of your graduation application (though still within the expected graduation period). Processing times can be reduced by personally retrieving and uploading the High School Diploma, which must be attached as a single PDF containing the front and back scans.

## Creating the Application

Once you click on _New Application_, the following screen will appear.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/i8da2lG.png">

Fields marked with an _asterisk_ are __mandatory__ to submit the Graduation Application. However, for our degree program, additional __mandatory fields__ are required. Specifically, the fields to be completed are:
- Advisor
- Co-advisor (only if required)
- Graduation Session
- Title __(see below for more information)__
- Attachments (i.e., the documents mentioned [above](#required-documents))

Other fields in the form are not required for the Graduation Application. Each field can be modified later, but only until the application is accepted. After submitting the application, you must wait for your __Advisor__ to approve it.

**Attention**

Once the Advisor approves the Graduation Application, it will no longer be possible to modify its data, except for the attached documents.

<i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation" style="color: #FFD43B;"></i>
The __Internship Report Title__ is not a mandatory field in the application form, but it is required for our degree program. If this field is empty when the Advisor approves the submitted application, you will no longer be able to enter the title. If this happens, you must contact the [Administrative Office](mailto:segrstudenti.i3s@uniroma1.it) as soon as possible.
{{% /hint %}}

Once the submission period for the selected Graduation Application session ends, all fields in the submitted and approved application will become __immutable and final__. Subsequently, the student must __submit__ their Internship Report according to the methods and deadlines specified on the "Graduation" section of the ["Attendance" subpage](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/en/course/33502/attendance) on the [ACSAI course page in the Course Catalogue](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/en/course/33502). Within two weeks after the Graduation Application deadline, the Student Office will verify the accuracy of the application and confirm it if everything is in order. In due time, an email will be sent containing information on the next steps in the graduation process.


## Cancellation and Withdrawal

If you decide to _cancel_ your submitted Graduation Application, you must distinguish between __Cancellation and Withdrawal__:
- The Cancellation procedure allows you to delete an already submitted application and submit a new one for the same session. This operation can only be done before the deadline for submitting the graduation application.
- The Withdrawal procedure allows you to delete an already submitted application and __RENOUNCE__ the possibility of submitting a new one in the same graduation session. This operation is __IRREVERSIBLE__, and once performed, you can only graduate in a session after the one you withdrew from. Neither the department nor the student office can modify the withdrawal. Your advisor can also withdraw your Graduation Application if deemed necessary. To graduate in the next session, you must submit a new application on Infostud.

To cancel the Graduation Application, you must contact the Student Office. To withdraw, you can simply use the dedicated button next to the graduation application.

If you mistakenly performed a Cancellation or Withdrawal of the application, you can try to contact the [Administrative Office](mailto:segrstudenti.i3s@uniroma1.it) as quickly as possible, and they will reach out to the Infostud service staff.

**Attention**

Please note that for Withdrawal, this procedure is __NOT PROVIDED__, as it is an irreversible operation. Therefore, the response from the Infostud staff may be negative. In some cases, it has been possible to restore the Graduation Application, but do not rely too much on this possibility.
