# Tutoring

Tutoring is a valuable resource offered by Sapienza to support students in their academic journey. Whether you are a first-year student trying to find your way within the university or a student who would benefit from support with specific courses, tutoring can help you overcome challenges and achieve your goals.

## Types of Tutoring

Sapienza offers two main types of tutoring.

### Tutoring for individual courses

Provides targeted support to help you understand course content and assist with exercises. The exercises done during tutoring sessions are often similar to those that will appear on the exam, or the tutors may be students who have already passed the exam. Therefore, **attending tutoring is one of the best ways to be well-prepared for the exam**.

#### How to benefit

Tutoring for individual courses is usually announced by the professor during class or on the e-learning platform (Moodle, Classroom, etc.) used for the course. Tutoring sessions are held **outside of regular class hours**, and **all interested students can participate**.
