# Computer Architecture (Unit 1)

> "*The course aims to teach how to design combinational and sequential circuits and to make students understand the principles used to design modern computers. In particular, the course deals with the internal structure of the microprocessor and the ideas that have allowed the extraordinary evolution of computing power over the last 30 years, such as pipelining, caching, branch prediction, and multi-processing.*"

## Exam dates & info

 - **Exam type**: written part + oral part;
    - **Written part**: lasts for 2:00h, for a maximum of 30 points. Is a practical exam with exercises over the whole program. **Must be passed with at least 18** in order to access to the oral;
    - **Oral part**: an oral exam over the theory explained in the course. It can increase or decrease the grade, depending on the performance. **Must be passed with at least 18** as final grade.

This exam **won't be registered** immediately on InfoStud. In order to be registered, you will have to pass also [Computer Architecture Unit 2](../../second-semester/comparch_u2/). Once you'll pass both exams, the final grade will be computed. Such grade is computed as follows:
$$
\text{Final Grade} = \Bigg\lceil \frac{\text{Grade Unit 1} + \text{Grade Unit 2}}{2} \Bigg\rceil
$$

Here follow two examples:

If you got 28 for Unit 1 and 30 for Unit 2, the final grade will be
$$
\Bigg\lceil \frac{28 + 30}{2} \Bigg\rceil = 29
$$

If you got 27 for Unit 1 and 30 for Unit 2, the final grade will be
$$
\Bigg\lceil \frac{27 + 30}{2} \Bigg\rceil = \lceil 28.5 \rceil = 29
$$
